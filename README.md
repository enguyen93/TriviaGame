# TriviaGame

This was a Trivia game assignment that I had fun doing. I'm not really into trivia so I made it more into a quiz with the same format.

Using my knowledge from my Bachelors of Science degree I made a little Nutritional quiz. I hope to one day collaborate with my old 
professor and push a learning platform for some of the students.

This project relied heavily on the use of timers, and basically my first time using jQuery.

I had a lot of fun doing this project though because before I knew it, I was done and I had learned so much.

I set up the game so that when you start on the first question the timer immediately begins. You have 60 seconds to answer each question.

At the end of the game it tells you how many you answered correctly/incorrectly. I plan to make it more student friendly later on by giving
hints if wanted.
